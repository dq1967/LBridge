0519
	- added reset the system if "AT+NOTI" command goes fail
	- added packet resend if no ACK, one time
	- added jackhammer method, go to sleep short two times to send packet if no BLE connect or BLE lost
	- extended BLE ON period to 60 s to match time window due to rewritten DexCollectionService
	- added automatic TXID change with packet resend for Wear Collection Service error (solved now)
0521	
	- added AT+RESET after wake BLE up -> test for better Weasr Collection Service interoperability
	- added AT+RENEW in configBLE() for reinitializing HM-1x modules by hand (uncomment only when you know what you do)
0522	
	- added serial command 'R' for sending AT+RENEW, enter command in first loop waiting for BLE connect
	- added serial command 'U' for uploading HM-1x firmware, enter command in first loop waiting for BLE 
		then close serial window, release serial port and open port with HM-1x tools to download (uncomment only when you know what you do)
0625
	- added 'X' command to display queued up readings
	- removed BG data smoothing 
	- added PWR DWN timer calibration to get exact 5 min time frames
	- gotosleep() now in sec raster to get exact sleep times
	- jackhammer method replaced by state machine, 2 times resending
	- added automatic increase of BLE to 60 s after too much fails in BLE connect
	- added 'V' command, battery voltage log in 2 h spacing
	- BLE name set to "LimiTTer" to avoid backswithcing to "xdrip wixel" hardware source (manual NFC scanning only in LimiTTer mode)
	- 5 times retry to do read_memory() in case of NFC fail
0709
	- added sensor lifetime transfer to xDrip+ by work around (every hour send current BG reading as LimiTTer type string)
		not working with Wear Collection Service
	- added statistics for battery consumption for Arduino mode, NFC mode and BLE mode
0713
	- modified NFC retry behavior, applied JoernLs mechanism to avoid possible sensor death maybe caused by LBridge
	- only send valid BG readings for better APS loop behavior, removed test code sending 0 or 1 for NFC scan error detection
	- no support for dead sensors as default (unwanted in APS loop systems)
	- added hard stop of sending BG readings after exactly 14 days and 12 h
	- changed spike suppression from +-50 to +-40 (rare spikes observed in LBrige on Arduino and Simblee)
0716
	- changed NFC reading error hanbdling. Avoid too much fast NFC re-read to avoid possible possible sensordeath.
	  Users reported sensordeath. Unsure about the reason, code changes may help (or not).
	  Function: After NFC failure wait 3 s and try again, 3 times. In case of block read error try again 3 times
	- spike suppression optimized, spike height is 40 mg/dl now.
	- two methods detecting dead sensors: after 20880 min or if 5 consequtive identical BG readings
	- removed debug/statistic code for voltage/queue to increase free RAM / avoid stack overflow
	- BD reading queue depth increased to 5 hours
	- 170810: changed dead sensor detection code at line #839 to detect faulty sensors before end of livetime (@NFCole)
